You may not: (i) make any copies of the Software other than an archival copy, (ii) modify or create any derivative works of the Software or documentation; (iii) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code, underlying ideas, or algorithms of the Software, or in any way ascertain, decipher, or obtain the communications protocols for accessing A GETCODE service or network; (iv) copy, reproduce, reuse in another product or service, modify, alter, or display in any manner any Javascript or HTML files, or parts thereof, included in the Software; (v) use the Software to develop software or services that access the address space of the Software or that intercept the proxy; (vi) attempt to gain unauthorized access to any GETCODE service, account, computer system or network associated with the Software; (vii) attempt to scrape, copy, resell or redistribute our databases either manually or through automated means; (viii) rent, lend, lease, sublicense or otherwise transfer rights to the Software; (ix) remove or alter any trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in the Software; (x) block, disable, or otherwise affect any advertising, advertisement banner window, tabs, links to other sites and services, or other features that constitute an integral part of the Software; (xi) incorporate, integrate or otherwise include the Software or any portion thereof (including the communications protocols) into any software, program or product that communicates, accesses, or otherwise connects with A GETCODE service or that interconnects any GETCODE service with any other instant messaging or other online service; (xii) use any GETCODE services associated with the Software in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair such services or interfere with any other party's use and enjoyment of them; (xiii) use the Software in any way that violates this Agreement or any law; (xiv) use the Software in any way that violates the rights of any third party; (xv) use the Software in any way to transmit, directly or indirectly, any unsolicited bulk communications (such as e-mails, voice, photos, video, chat or SPIM instant messages); or (xvi) authorize or assist any third party or use automated means to do any of the things described in this paragraph.</p>

<p>The Software is offered in the United States. You understand and agree that the Software (i) is not designed or customized for distribution for any specific country or jurisdiction (“Territory”) and (b) is not intended for distribution to, or use by, any person or entity in any Territory where such distribution or use would be contrary to local law or regulation. You are solely responsible for compliance with local laws as applicable when you use the Software.</p>

<p>5. CONTENT. Content that may be accessed through the use of the Software, including any links to certain web sites and RSS fees offered with the Software, is the property of its respective owner. This Agreement does not give you a license to use such content. We make no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy or reliability of the information included in such content. Use of any websites or services reached through the Software is subject to the terms of use presented on such website or service. Any Internet-based services we provide for use with the Software are subject to separate terms and conditions. You must abide by those terms if you use our services through the Software. The content on the linked sites is provided to you for your personal, non-commercial use as a convenience to you.</p>

<p>6. REGISTRATION. We and our affiliates provide interactive online services for use with the Software, such as e-mail and other services. In order to access these services, you must be a user of the GETCODE Service and have a valid log-in credential, such as an GETCODE username. If you are not a member, you may join by going to www. GETCODE.com. You must agree to abide by the terms and conditions that may apply to any interactive online service that you elect to use with the Software.</p>

<p>7. SUGGESTIONS. You agree that GETCODE may use in any manner, without limitation and for no compensation, all comments, suggestions, complaints and other feedback you provide relating to the Software.</p>

<p>8. YOUR REPRESENTATIONS. You represent and warrant that you have adequate legal capacity to enter into this Agreement, that you will use the Software only for lawful purposes, and that you will not violate the terms of this Agreement.</p>

<p>9. LATENT DISTRIBUTION. Some of the Software has been designed so that it can be delivered in segments to ensure that the download will be quick and convenient. In such cases, a small piece of software (the "Stub") may be installed initially that can then "call out" over the Internet to a web server and complete its installation on your computer at a later time (i) during the installation process, (ii) when the Stub detects that you have available bandwidth, or (iii) when you have requested use of a function that requires that portion of the Software. This mechanism will only be used to complete the installation of the Software you have chosen to install.</p>

<p>10. AUTOMATED UPDATES AND REINSTALLATIONS. We may deliver to your computer automated updates, upgrades, modifications, and/or patches to address issues such as security, interoperability, and performance (collectively “Updates”). You may be given the opportunity to choose whether you want all Updates delivered automatically or you would prefer to be notified when a new Update is ready to be installed. You authorize us to deliver automatically any Update if we believe it is necessary to provide for the continued functionality of the Software. Your use of the Updates will be governed by this Agreement unless you are asked to agree to new or additional terms and conditions at the time of download or installation.</p>

<p>11. PERFORMANCE AND USAGE INFORMATION.</p>

<p>(a) TECHNICAL INFORMATION. Most of the Software is configured to report back information automatically relating to computer errors arising in connection with use of the Software, without notice to you. Information on your Software configuration settings may be included. This data is sent to us to help diagnose performance issues with, and improve, the Software.</p>

<p>(b) FEATURE USAGE INFORMATION. The Software may also provide us with anonymous information about use of our features and buttons on the Software. We use this information in the aggregate to determine which Software features and buttons are most popular and useful to its users.</p>

<p>(c) SOFTWARE ID. The Software may contain a specific identification number for the purpose of tracking the number of unique instances of the Software in use.</p>

<p>(d) PERSONALIZATION. You may be asked to provide us with certain information so that we can personalize content presented to you through the Software. For example, you may be asked for your zip code, which could be used to provide you with relevant local weather and/or news reports.</p>

<p>12. ADDITIONAL FEATURES, TERMS. Additional products, software and services from us and our affiliates may be made available through the Software. Any additional components that we may offer from time-to-time (such as, in the form of upgrades or additional features) may be subject to additional terms, which will supplement this Agreement. Generally, new versions to the Software will be subject to a separate license agreement. Appendix 1 contains a list of components included with the initial delivery of the Software. The Software may include the GETCODE Toolbar. If you elected to install the GETCODE Toolbar, it will show up as an extra toolbar in your Internet Explorer browser, giving you easy access to our products, services, and features. If you mistype a web address, the GETCODE Toolbar will offer suggested similar addresses using the GETCODE Search service.</p>

<p>13. DEFAULT SETTINGS. GETCODE Search will be set as the default search engine in the Software. If you misspell a web address or enter a non-existent domain, your default browser will display search results from GETCODE Search instead of an error page. GETCODE.com will be set as your default homepage in the Software. To make it easier to access our features and services, a shortcut, quick launch toolbar icon, and system tray icon for the Software may be added to your desktop.</p>

<p>14. THIRD PARTY OFFERINGS. Third parties may from time to time offer applications or services to access, “plug-into” or interact with the Software. You may only use third-party applications authorized by us for use with the Software. Your use of any third-party applications will be at your own risk and subject to the terms and conditions of those third parties. We make no representations or warranties, express or implied, regarding the third party applications. You agree that we are under no obligation to provide you with any error corrections, updates, upgrades, fixes and/or enhancements to make the Software accessible through or compatible with these third-party applications.</p>

<p>15. DIGITAL CERTIFICATES. Certain components of the Software support certain cryptographic and authentication features, including but not limited to Secure Sockets Layer and S/MIME communications, that may require the installation and/or use of a digital certificate. Digital certificates are issued, validated, and revoked by third-party certification authorities ("CAs"). We have no control over the certification process of any CA. You are solely responsible for familiarizing yourself with the terms and conditions established by a CA for the use of, or reliance upon, its digital certificates, including but not limited to any obligation to validate a digital certificate, maintain the security of a cryptographic key or password, or pay fees for certification services. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DECISION TO USE OR RELY UPON A DIGITAL CERTIFICATE. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE VALIDITY OR ACCURACY OF ANY DIGITAL CERTIFICATE, OR FOR THE SECURITY OR INTEGRITY OF ANY TRANSACTION OR COMMUNICATION AUTHENTICATED BY A DIGITAL CERTIFICATE.</p>

<p>16. USE AND AVAILABILITY OF OPEN SOURCE CODE. Portions of some of the Software may have been created using source code available through various open source projects. In such cases, the licenses and availability of source code for such components are specified in a copyright notice document delivered with or linked from such Software.</p>

<p>17. TERMINATION. This agreement automatically terminates if you fail to comply with the terms hereof or if you attempt to assign the agreement or transfer the software to a third party except as expressly permitted in this agreement. Upon termination, you must stop all use of the software and must destroy all copies of the Software that are in your possession. All provisions of this Agreement, except for the license grant in Section 3 above, survive the termination of this Agreement. We may take any technical remedies to prevent unsolicited bulk communications from entering, utilizing, or remaining within our computer or communications networks.</p>

<p>18. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. You agree that your breach or threatened breach of this Agreement will cause us irreparable damage for which recovery of money damages would be inadequate and that we, therefore, may obtain timely injunctive relief to protect its rights under this Agreement in addition to any and all other remedies available at law or in equity.</p>

<p>19. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</p>

<p>WE LICENSE THE SOFTWARE “AS IS” AND WITH ALL FAULTS. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THIS SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT ITS OPERATION WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY, EFFORT AND COST OF ANY SERVICE AND REPAIR IS WITH YOU.</p>

<p>WE AND OUR LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL EXPRESS WARRANTIES AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INTERFERENCE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR ACCURACY, UNLESS SUCH IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE LEGALLY INCAPABLE OF EXCLUSION.</p>

<p>NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY US OR A GETCODE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF ANY WARRANTY THAT CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. GETCODE AND ITS LICENSORS HAVE NO LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE.</p>

<p>IF ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY MAY NOT BE DISCLAIMED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, THEN SUCH IMPLIED WARRANTY IS LIMITED TO 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE YOU ACQUIRED THE SOFTWARE FROM US OR OUR AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTOR.</p>

<p>IF YOU ELECT TO UNINSTALL CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE SOFTWARE, YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS AND USE CERTAIN OR ALL OF THE INTERACTIVE ONLINE SERVICES PROVIDED BY US FOR USE WITH THE SOFTWARE.</p>

IN ANY CASE, THE GETCODE GROUP'S ENTIRE COLLECTIVE LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE THE SUM OF THE FEES YOU PAID FOR THIS LICENSE (IF ANY) AND REPLACEMENT OF DEFECTIVE MEDIA OR PROVISION OF A REASONABLY SIMILAR SOFTWARE PRODUCT, AS DETERMINED AT GETCODE 'S SOLE DISCRETION, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF GETCODE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS THE LIMITATION OF DAMAGES IN SUCH CASES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THE GETCODE GROUP IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF CONTENT PROVIDED BY YOU OR A THIRD PARTY THAT IS ACCESSED THROUGH THE SOFTWARE AND/OR ANY MATERIAL LINKED THROUGH SUCH CONTENT.</p>

<p>21. NO SUPPORT OR UPGRADE OBLIGATIONS. We are not obligated to create or provide any support, corrections, updates, upgrades, bug fixes and/or enhancements of the Software.</p>

<p>23. HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES. The Software is not fault-tolerant and is not designed, manufactured or intended for use in environments in which its failure could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage, such as in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control, direct life support machines, or weapons systems ("High Risk Activities"). ACCORDINGLY, WE AND OUR SUPPLIERS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES. YOU AGREE THAT THE GETCODE GROUP WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIMS OR DAMAGES ARISING FROM THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE IN SUCH APPLICATIONS.</p>

<p>24. U.S. GOVERNMENT END-USERS.
