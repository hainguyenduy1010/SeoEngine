<h3>The best results from the entire Internet</h3>
<br>
Most of the time search engines allow you to only search for one type of information at one time. They may have billions of web pages to display, but they only show one set of results. For example, text that is found on the relevant web pages.
<br><br>
GetCode searches multiple types of information from multiple sources to generate optimal results. In just one overview, you are able to get web pages, videos, news, products and results seen from Wikipedia. This enables you to obtain a clearer and complete picture of what the web has to offer. With one entry you search for the answer in the worlds largest search sources and therefore get better and more results!
<br><br>
A single search engine mostly searches for one particular type of information. GetCode provides full and thorough search results, made up of various types of information.
